Instead of conducting a new systematic search from scratch, we base our review on the studies included in these reviews.\n\nFirst, we extract all references from studies included in the reviews, identify duplicates and merge all references into a de-duplicated data frame that we will use for the screening. We then have two screening stages: A first round of screening will be based on the abstract. All articles that pass this stage will be selected for full-text analysis.\n\nAll steps of this literature review are documented.\n\n\n",
