For our meta-analysis, for each experiment, we only pair one control and one treatment group. In a case where we needed to make a selection, we have coded our selection choice in the variables `intervention_selection` and  `control_selection`. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] \"paper_id\"                              \n [2] \"experiment_id\"                         \n [3] \"subject_id\"                            \n [4] \"news_id\"                               \n [5] \"country\"                               \n [6] \"veracity\"                              \n [7] \"condition\"                             \n [8] \"intervention_label\"                    \n [9] \"intervention_description\"              \n[10] \"intervention_selection\"                \n[11] \"intervention_selection_description\"    \n[12] \"control_format\"                        \n[13] \"accuracy_raw\"                          \n[14] \"scale\"                                 \n[15] \"originally_identified_treatment_effect\"\n[16] \"partisan_identity\"                     \n[17] \"age\"                                   \n[18] \"news_selection\"                        \n[19] \"concordance\"                           \n[20] \"news_slant\"                            \n[21] \"year\"                                  \n[22] \"accuracy\"                              \n[23] \"recycled_news\"                         \n[24] \"recycled_news_reference\"               \n[25] \"control_selection\"                     \n[26] \"control_selection_description\"         \n[27] \"age_range\"                             \n[28] \"id\"                                    \n[29] \"long_term\"                             \n[30] \"time_elapsed\"                          \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# data |> \n#   filter(\n#     # for cases where there was an intervention selection, make sure to only pick the selected intervention\n#     is.na(intervention_selection) | intervention_label == intervention_selection,\n#     # same but for the control\n#     is.na(control_selection) | control_label == control_selection\n#   )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Exclude long_term effects\n\nSome studies measured long_term effects.
